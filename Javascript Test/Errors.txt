Error 1:
The brackets "()" at the last line is not needed. Because we are not defining the function as an independent one. We are trying to use this function as a parameter.

Error 2:
At line no: 44 and 63
	domaths and doMaths --> spelling mistake. The name has to be in same letter case in Javascript

Error 3:
Inside maths.addInteger --> Line no: 11
	result is not defined  --> We have used "use strict" - so all the variables has to be declared before use.

Error 4:
Line no: 53
 console.log("Multiplication result = ' + sum2.output);  --> Quotes mismatch
 
Error 5: 
 Line 35 and 36:
 
		return 
        {input : sequence, output : result};
		
	Both should be in same line. Because JS treats 'return' with a 'retutn;', since ; is automatically added in JS parsing
		
	
Error 6:
Line no: 21	
	if (sequence.length = 0) {
		Usage of '=' instead of '==' in If condition

Error 7:
Line 25 and 29
                var result = result * maths.getInteger(sequence[i]);
				Second, result, inside the loop need not be defined again as it will clear the previous value and cause ambiguity.


Additional suggestions

suggestion 1:

    maths.getInteger = function (x) {
        var result = parseInt(x);
        if (result) {
            return result;
        }
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    };

This can return 0 if any string is passed as input value, rather than giving a Undefined as output.
	
Suggestion 2:
	
	In maths.multiplyInteger
Also, for loop of Multiply --> if any number is 0 just return 0 and break the for loop instead of looping through entire data. if data is huge it can save some instructions.
